# Country_dataSet_Unsupervised_ML


Unsupervised Machine Learning Brief


### Requirements
Description in general with detailed list of requirements.
1. Start with some exploration of the data – what are the fields, how are they distributed,
will they require any transformations?
2. Prepare the dataset for machine learning
3. Create an unsupervised machine learning model
4. Measure the accuracy of your model

#### Deliverables
You should submit your code along with some analysis. Your analysis can be presented as presentation slides, or using something like Jupyter Notebooks.

Dataset 3 – Country Data for Charity
This dataset contains socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of countries. The purpose of the dataset is to help a charity fighting poverty to identify groups of countries where it is needed most.
Example insight: Which countries can be grouped together and have the highest need of help from the charity?
File name: country-data.csv

#### Extension
To extend the project, try using two different unsupervised learning algorithms and use methods to measure their accuracy. Which model would you choose? Why
